下一代防火墙客户端（边缘侧软件）
</h1>

<h2 align="center"> 
该软件模块主要借助网上开源的Slips软件二次开发，Slips是一个综合的网络安全系统，可以对多种安全威胁进行发现。
客户端主要借助其flowmldetection功能来进行流量检测，对特定端口的数据进行抓取与标注后保存到数据库或者表格中，再把这部分数据通过kafka上传到云端进行模型训练。

本软件在工作过程中，打开GUI_firewall以及new——receive即可正常工作（需要保证云端打开了zookeeper以及kafka服务）

## Features

Slips is a Python-based intrusion prevention system that uses machine learning to detect malicious behaviors in the network traffic. Slips was designed to focus on targeted attacks, to detect of command and control channels and to provide good visualisation for the analyst. Slips is able to analyze real live traffic from the device and the large network captures in the type of a pcap files, Suricata, Zeek/Bro and Argus flows. As a result, Slips highlights suspicious behaviour and connections that needs to be deeper analyzed. 

Slips is a modular software. Each module is designed to perform a specific detection in the network traffic. Current version of Slips contains following modules:

|   module  |   description | status |
| ---| --- | :-: |
| https | training&test of RandomForest to detect malicious https flows |⏳|
| port scan detector | detects Horizontal and Vertical port scans |✅|
| threat Intelligence | checks if each IP is in a list of malicious IPs  |✅|
| timeline |  creates a timeline of what happened in the network based on all the flows and type of data available  |✅|
| rnn-cc-detection | detects command and control channels using recurrent neural network and the stratosphere behavioral letters |✅|
| VirusTotal | module to lookup IP address on VirusTotal |✅|
| flowalerts | module to find malicious behaviour in each flow. Current measures are: long duration of the connection, successful ssh |✅|
| IP_Info | module to find Geolocation, ASN, RDNS info about IPs and MAC vendors  |✅|
| CESNET | Send and receive alerts from warden servers |✅|
| RiskIQ | Module to get different information from RiskIQ  |✅|
| ARP | module to check for ARP attacks in ARP traffic  |✅|
| ExportingAlerts | module to export alerts to slack, STIX or suricata-like JSON format |✅|
| http_analyzer | module to analyze HTTP traffic |✅|
| blocking | module to block malicious IPs connecting to the device |✅|
| flowmldetection | module to detect malicious flows using ML pretrained models |✅|
| leak_detector | module to  detect leaks of data in the traffic using YARA rules |✅|



Slips has its own console graphical user interface called Kalipso. Kalipso summarizes the detections performed by Slips in colorful graphs and tables.

## Training of machine learning models from your data

Slips can also be used in _training_ mode with traffic from the user, so that the machine learning model can be **extended** with the users' traffic to improve detection.
To use this feature you need to modify the configuration file ```slips.conf``` to add in the ```[flowmldetection]``` section:

    mode = train

And also you need to specify the label of the traffic you are adding with:

    label = normal

After this, just run slips normally in your data (interface or any input file) and the machine learning model will be updated automatically.
To use the new model, just reconfigure slips in test mode

    mode = train

## Installation

The easiest way to run Slips is inside a docker. Current version of Slips docker can analyze network captures (pcap, Zeek flows, Argus flows, etc.), but it is not able to analyze real live traffic from inside the docker. If you need to analyze the traffic from your computer, use the native version.

## How to use Slips docker from DockerHub and share files between the host and the docker:

        mkdir ~/dataset
        cp <some-place>/myfile.pcap ~/dataset
        docker run -it --rm --net=host -v $(pwd)/dataset:/StratosphereLinuxIPS/dataset stratosphereips/slips:latest
        ./slips.py -c slips.conf -f dataset/myfile.pcap

## How to build Slips docker from Dockerfile:

        docker build --no-cache -t slips -f docker/ubuntu-image/Dockerfile .
        docker run -it --rm --net=host slips
        ./slips.py -c slips.conf -f dataset/test3.binetflow

## If you want to allow Slips inside the docker to analyze and block the traffic in your Linux host, run docker with --cap-add=NET_ADMIN. And run with -p

        docker run -it --rm --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN stratosphereips/slips:latest
        ./slips.py -c slips.conf -i eno1 -p


## If you want to run Slips locally on bare metal
The easiest way is to use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for Python environment management. 
Note that if you want to analyze PCAPs, you need to have either `zeek` or `bro` installed. Check [slips.py](slips.py) and usage of `check_zeek_or_bro` function.
Slips also needs Redis for interprocess communication, you can either install Redis on bare metal and run `redis-server --daemonize yes` or you can use docker version
and execute `docker run --rm -d --name slips_redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`.
```bash
# clone repository
git@github.com:stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS.git && cd StratosphereLinuxIPS
# create conda environment and download all python dependencies
conda env create -f conda-environment.yaml
# activate conda environment
conda activate slips 
# and finally run slips
./slips.py -c slips.conf -f dataset/myfile.pcap
```

You can now put pcap files or other flow files in the ./dataset/ folder and analyze them
